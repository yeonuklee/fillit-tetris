Fillit is a project who let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming : searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of pos- sibilities. In this particular project, you will be charged of creating an algorithm which fits some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible square.

A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure that most of you might knows thanks to the popular game Tetris.

Fillit does not consist of recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your program will take a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos and arrange them to create the smallest square possible. Obviously, your main goal is to find this smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite a exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
Then, you will have to think carefully about your data structures and your solving algorithm, if you want your program answers before the next millenium.
